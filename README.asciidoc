== JeZ - Jenkins Easy

_That project is still a *work-in-progress*._

The idea is to provide of an opinionated packaged Jenkins installation, made easy to version and autoscale.
This is provided as a Docker image : link:https://hub.docker.com/r/batmat/jez[batmat/jez].

== In a bit more details

* Job DSL plugin to version all the jobs
* Docker plugin to scale
** The idea is to push builds into a Docker Swarm cluster
* Workflow plugin pre-installed to encourage


=== Why the eff that name?

Well, first, don't take it too seriously (the name I mean :-))
But it comes from Jez Humble,
one of the most famous proponents of the _Continuous Delivery_ movement :-).
